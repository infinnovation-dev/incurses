This is a minimal implementation of an ncurses-like API.
The aim is to allow the [Atto](https://github.com/hughbarney/atto) Emacs-like text editor to be run in embedded environments,
in particular ARM's [mbed](https://www.mbed.com) operating system.

The licence is MIT-style.

Only those aspects of the API that are used by Atto are implemented in the first instance.
